        <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

        <p>The project is meant to make the user visualize and create music by blendng different instruments together. In our virtual environment, there are four rooms with different themes that the user can explore. In each room, there are four instruments that go together to make a certain genre. The four genres represented are Classical, Caribbean, Rock and Electronic.</p>

        <p>As the user explores, they can turn on different instruments that are all syncronized to the same song, "Dragostea Din Tei". When instruments are selected, the user can hear the audio associated with that instrument and see a waveform for the corresponding audio. Users can mix and match different instruments to make their own creation, or simply hear each genre or instrument on their own.</p>

        <p> The main motivation for this project was from the desire to hear a song in different genres. We also wanted to visualize wave forms because we all had a passion for music in which lasers are used to represent beats in a song (like at an EDM concert). We thought it would be cool to combine the ideas so that is how we came up with our final idea for Waves VR. 

        <h3>
        <a id="description" class="anchor" href="#description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why in VR?</h3>

        <p>Virtual Reality presents researchers, and curious minds alike a bold new way to interact with art, music, and data. Virtual Reality alone cannot rival these individual fields in 
          their respective domains (e.g. a museum, a concert, an advanced simulation), but rather it allows the user to interact and be inspired in a new fashion, by combining convenience and new sensations. In our particular experience, we cannot rival the powerful audio editing suites that exist, but we can provide something that those tools cannot... a chance to 
          experience the musics ability to enhance a world of the users own imagination.</p>

        <h3>
          <a id="description" class="anchor" href="#description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Insight Objective</h3>

        <p>
            We believe that our project has two major insights:

            First, the experience should teach the user about how music is composed. This is done by showing the user various different instruments like drums and guitars and allowing the user to toggle the instrument on and off. The 16 total instruments are divided up into four different genres (4 instruments per genre). This should allow the users to gain insight on not only how the different instruments play together, but the similarities and differences of the instruments in different genres.

            Second, the user should be able to gain insight on how various waveforms differ for different instruments. The wave bubbles surrounding each instrument are affected the actual shape of the wave that the instrument produces. The user will be able to tell the differences between the waveforms of different instruments and how they affect the overall song.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also had three participants test our project to see what insights they could infer. 

          Our first participant, Sabrina Gutierrez, mentioned that she did not know much at all about music composition nor how waveforms are composed. 
          After her run-through of WavesVR, she mentioned that she gained insight on how each instrument has a different waveform and how they wll differ. She also thought the Steel Drum version of the song was interesting.

          Our second participant, Bryce Sperling, said he had a limited knowledge of music composition and waveforms. 
          After the experience, he said was able to gain insight on how the song was composed of different parts. He also mentioned that composing music was a fun endeavour. He said that the project opened his eyes to how waveforms are associated with various instruments in songs. He said this was really emphasized by how the drum waveform differed from the rest of the instruments.

          Our last participant, James Risberg, knew a lot about waveforms but not much about music composition. 
          After his run-through, he mentioned that the vocals really added to the music composition and that the steel drum version of the song was his favorite. 
        </p>

        <p> 
          So, in conclusion, our predicitions were pretty accurate. All of the users reported some insight gained from the music composition process, they also seemed to enjoy themselves during the process. Also, two out of three users mentioned the waveforms provided insight on to how the insturments work with the rest of the song.

        <p>Simulation sickness is an unfortunate side-effect of this particular technology. In order to reduce the effects on our testers we aimed to provide the maximum frames per second (fps) to provide a smooth experience. Furthermore we modified the movement controller to allow the character to move with respect to its relative position rather then the world coordinates. Unfortunately the effects of motion effects will always be felt my certain users, but these steps in combination with improving hardware will go a long way in expanding opportunities for VR.</p>
